# 🚲 Yulu Bike Sharing Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of hourly bike rentals from the Yulu bike-sharing system. The goal is to explore rental patterns, understand the impact of different factors (weather, season, time of day), and provide insights into user behavior. 

By leveraging data visualization and statistical analysis, we aim to identify key trends and optimize bike-sharing operations.
